# EzWindSLIC
An activator for Windows 7 for UEFI-GPT systems, based on WindSLIC but this one is more user friendly.
Using this activator is very simple. Open the batch file, the script will self-elevate and will automatically detect your OS. The script will install an OEM SLP product key, a custom bootloader and an XRML certificate.

Supported products: Windows Vista Home Basic, Windows Vista Home Basic N, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Business N, Windows Vista Ultimate, Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Home Premium E, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Professional E, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Ultimate E, Windows Server 2008 Standard, Windows Server 2008 Enterprise, Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard, Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter, Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise.

If you get an error running the activator then:
Make sure that you have a UEFI motherboard and are NOT booted into legacy mode. Try using Daz' Windows Loader. Your OS may not be supported.

To uninstall this activator:
Run the batch file again. When the script prompts you press any key to uninstall and reboot when prompted.

To use a custom product key:
Open an admin command prompt, and launch the script with a '-custom' switch. WARNING: MAKE SURE THE CUSTOM PRODUCT KEY YOU TYPE IS EXACTLY 29 CHARACTERS AND DOES NOT HAVE SPACES! If you do not heed this warning, your computer WILL NOT BOOT!
