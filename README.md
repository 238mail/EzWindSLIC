# EzWindSLIC
An activator for Windows 7 for UEFI-GPT systems, based on WindSLIC but this one is more user friendly.
You have two options: you can either use the batch version, which can easily be edited and not detected by antiviruses, or you can use the .exe version which cannot be edited and is detected by antiviruses.
Using this activator is very simple. Open the batch file or executable, the script will self-elevate and will automatically detect your OS. The script will install an OEM SLP product key, a custom bootloader and an XRML certificate.
Supported products: Windows Vista Home Basic, Windows Vista Home Basic N, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Business N, Windows Vista Ultimate, Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Home Premium E, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Professional E, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Ultimate E.

If you get an error running the activator then:
Make sure that you have a UEFI motherboard and are NOT booted into legacy mode. Try using Daz' Windows Loader.
Your OS may not be supported.
